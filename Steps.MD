UI:
stack: react.js
component library: material UI
framework : vite

Step 1: 

setting a very basic hello word app !

The Vite + React app has been scaffolded in your frontend directory!

Next steps:
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Add Material UI after that.

Would you like me to proceed with npm install and then set up Material UI for your "Hello World" app?
